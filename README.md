# GameBox
GameBox is going to be a platform for users to host and play games, with support for both downloading and running externally and also running off of our own services

Primarily this app will be dedicated to host games from CPTC alike (see [here](https://github.com/CPTC-Gaming-Team/GameBox/discussions/13))

Below is a page drawn from [Alex Fischer](https://github.com/SuperGamer001) showing the potential vision for the User's profile page
